# Simple Trims
### Trims are way too complicated. Let's change that.

_Inspired by [All The Trims](https://github.com/benjamin-norton/AllTheTrims). Thank you!_

This project was orignally a fork of All the Trims, until I realized I did not need most of the things in that mod, and I realised
what I _did_ need I was better off writing myself. All the Trims was used as a reference for some features, however.

## **This is a work in Progress!**
_Here be dragons_
- There are a parts of this mod incomplete:
  - Simple Armor Trim Templates

### Features:
- Simplifies the process of adding a new trim material or pattern, in contrast to the original project adding support for all items
- Makes all armor eligible for trims, including modded armor. (This feature is functionally identical to that of All The Trims)
- Works parallel to vanilla's system

#### For those who wish to create custom trims using this mod:
- Once the system is functional, I will be creating a wiki on how to use this system.
- Vanilla Packs for armor trims _should_ still work. I plan to write this system to work in parallel to the vanilla one.
